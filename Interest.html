                        My favourite video game is Honkai: Star Rail (HSR). 
                        I play it whenever I'm free. 
                        HSR is a turn-based RPG with stunning visuals, immersive storytelling, and unforgettable characters that keep me hooked every time I log in. 
                        Whether it’s exploring new worlds, grinding for relics, or pulling for my favourite characters, the game always gives me something fun to look forward to.

                    <h1>My Favourite Exercises</h1>
                    <p>
                        My favourite exercises are jogging and hiking because they let me enjoy nature while staying active and clearing my mind. 
                        Jogging helps me maintain my stamina, while hiking gives me a sense of achievement every time I reach a viewpoint. 
                        I also like playing badminton with my friends—it’s fast-paced, fun, and a great way for us to bond. On top of that, 
                        I sometimes work out at the gym to build strength and improve my overall fitness. With this mix of activities, 
                        I get to stay healthy while keeping my exercise routine enjoyable and balanced.

                <h1>What is my passion?</h1>
                <p>I enjoy watching tech blogs during my free time, as they help me stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the industry. During the semester break, I dedicated some time to self-learning through resources like YouTube tutorials and the Huawei Talent website. My goal was to strengthen my fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Linux command-line interface (CLI).
                    Through this self-learning journey, I not only practiced coding and building simple web pages but also gained a deeper understanding of how web technologies and operating systems work together. This experience helped me develop problem-solving skills and reinforced my ability to learn independently, preparing me for more advanced projects in web development and IT.</br>
                    Here is a mini game I made by following a tutorial from the YouTube channel SuperSimpleDev, which is displayed on the left side.
